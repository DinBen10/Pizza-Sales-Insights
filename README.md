# Pizza-Sales-Insights
Data Analysis using SQL

# Project Description:

As part of this project, I conducted in-depth data analysis using SQL to gain valuable insights into the pizza sales performance of a business. The primary objective was to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualize various aspects of the data to identify trends and patterns. The project involved the following:

# KPI Analysis:

To assess the business performance, I calculated the following metrics:

Total Revenue: Determined the overall revenue generated from pizza sales.

Average Order Value: Calculated the average value of each order placed.

Total Pizzas Sold: Analyzed the total number of pizzas sold.

Total Orders: Evaluated the overall number of orders received.

Average Pizzas per Order: Computed the average number of pizzas included in each order.

# Chart Creation:

To gain a deeper understanding and effectively communicate the findings, I created the following charts using SQL:

Daily Trend for Total Orders: Visualized the daily order trends to identify any recurring patterns or fluctuations.

Hourly Trend for Total Orders: Explored the hourly distribution of orders to pinpoint peak and off-peak periods.

Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category: Illustrated the distribution of sales across different pizza categories to identify the most popular choices.

Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size: Presented the breakdown of sales by pizza sizes to determine customer preferences.

Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category: Created a chart to showcase the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category.

Top 5 Best Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold: Highlighted the top five best-selling pizzas based on total pizza sales.

Bottom 5 Worst Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold: Identified the bottom five worst-selling pizzas based on total pizza sales.
